## Preparation

1. Create a 'code' folder in the root directory of your repository.
1. Inside the 'code' folder, create a file '01_clean_data.\<your_extension_here\>'.
Your extension should be the one you use for your programming language of choice (e.g., '.R' for R, '.py' for Python, '.jl' for Julia).
1. Copy any code from HW_02 you need to subset and merge the NRI and SVI datasets into the '01_clean_data' file.
1. Add a 'processed' directory to the 'data' folder.
1. Add a line at the end of the file that saves the merged dataset to 'data/processed' directory.
1. Run the '01_clean_data' file to ensure that the merged dataset runs and creates the proper file.
1. Add and commit the '01_clean_data' file to the repository.



## Homework - Principal Component Analysis

The CDC Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) takes multiple differen population-level inputs (e.g., % of the population living in poverty, % of the population without health insurance) to identify particularly vulnerable counties.
While the CDC SVI scores rely on adding up the percentiles of various characteristics, there are alternative indexes (e.g., [University of South Carolina SoVI index](https://sc.edu/study/colleges_schools/artsandsciences/centers_and_institutes/hvri/data_and_resources/sovi/index.php)) that use methods like PCA.
Here, we are going to use the CDC SVI data to create an alternative index based on PCA.
